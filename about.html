  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img src="aboutmepic.png" alt="Ilef Toukebri">
  <p>
    From Tunisia to Budapest, and from numbers to design, I followed my heart. An art-oriented soul with roots that nurture my visual language to transform stories, memories, and emotions into tangibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trained in product design, but an artist at heart, my work bridges the worlds of functional design and creative expression. It moves across disciplines: product design, multidisciplinary art, and visual storytelling, always guided by curiosity, color, and a sense of creativity.
